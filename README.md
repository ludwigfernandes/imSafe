**imSAFE - An Emergency Safety App**

**Project Overview:**

Developed as a project submission to Goa University for the BCA degree, this app focuses on providing instant assistance and fostering collaborative vigilance to create a secure environment for all residents.

**Key Features:**

- **GPS Tracking:** The app enables live location sharing during emergencies, ensuring timely assistance from emergency services.
- **Counseling Support:** Users can access counseling services anytime for psychological support and guidance.
